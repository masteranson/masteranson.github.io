### Research Project: Evaporation Kinetics of Nano Water Droplets using Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamic Simulations

I have been involved in the Environmental Process Modeling Centre in the Nanyang Environmental and Water Research Institute in Singapore between June-August 2018 and May-July 2019. During which one of my principle investigations were on the science behind interfacial water evaporation. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to use the Nanyang Technological University's High Performance Computing Centre to run large scale simulations using `LAMMPS`.
