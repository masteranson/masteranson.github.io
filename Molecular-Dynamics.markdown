### Research Project: Evaporation Kinetics of Nano Water Droplets using Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamic Simulations
---
<div align="justify">
I worked as a research assistant in the Environmental Process Modeling Centre at
Nanyang Environmental and Water Research Institute in Singapore between June-August 2018 and May-July 2019.
One of my principle investigations during that period were on some of the science behind interfacial water evaporation.
I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to use the Nanyang Technological University's
High Performance Computing Centre to run large scale simulations using <code>LAMMPS</code> .<br />

Essentially by simulating a nanoscale system, we can take meaningful statistical averages and interpret the phenomea in macroscopic terms while assuming sufficient ergodicity.
Why it works? I have no clue, but if you don't believe the science you can read more about it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2800798/pdf/nihms-127989.pdf">here</a> .

One of the biggest discoveries from this computational study was it clearly demonstrated how blah blah blah. As shown in the figure below, we see how a pressure gradient across the interfacial boundary relaxes as net evaporation flux approaches zero.

Result of blah blah blah.

Detail findings are submitted in a manuscript to the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer pending acceptance.
