### Research Project: Evaporation Kinetics of Nano Water Droplets using Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamic Simulations

<div align="justify"> I worked as a research assistant in the Environmental Process Modeling Centre at Nanyang Environmental and Water Research Institute in Singapore between June-August 2018 and May-July 2019. One of my principle investigations during that period were on the science behind interfacial water evaporation. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to use the Nanyang Technological University's High Performance Computing Centre to run large scale simulations using `LAMMPS`.</div>
