I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate from Hong Kong passionate about the environment.
With experience in energy storage, evaporation modeling, and electric vehicles, I am looking to pursue new opportunities in the field of sustainable technologies.
Having previously interned at <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_377odrFY">Tesla</a>,
and <a href="https://www.ampd.energy">AMPD Energy</a>, I also understand the challenges in translating lab-scale technologies into a marketable products.
Now working on electrochemical nitrogen reduction at the <a href="https://www.hatzelllab.gatech.edu/">Hatzell Lab</a>, I hope to continue exploring interdisciplinary research that are environmentally and socially conscious at the graduate level.
In my free time, I like to do Olympic weightlifting and play piano. I speak Cantonese, English, and Mandarin fluently. <br />
