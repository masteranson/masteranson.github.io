In the world of increasing electrification, a lot of academic and commercial interests are drawn into alternatives to lithium ion.
Zinc, being one the most abundant metal on Earth, offers a high theoretical capacity (820 mAh/g) without the toxicity and safety risks inherent with lithium based batteries.
 However, many technical challenges remain unsolved in order to increase the performance of zinc-based aqueous batteries to practical engineering standards.

<br />
<br />

On the electrochemical front, two dominating failure mechanisms, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2F0378-7753%2891%2980117-G">dentritic growth and shape change</a>, continue to plague the development
 of zinc batteries for the past 30 years. To overcome these challenges, the porous zinc metal electrode needs to maintain the electrically conductive Zn 'network' under high depths of discharge.

### Importance of a bicontinuous structure
---
<div align="justify">
To achieve this optimal electrode structure, we designed a new, simple process to electrochemically reduce a ZnO powder precursor into a bicontinuous metal zinc anode,
very similar to structure through derived from a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.9b09669">monolithic salt precursor.</a>
The current reduction pathway is a two step process:
</div>

<p>
  \[ZnO + H_2O + 2OH^{-} → Zn(OH)_4^{2-}\]
  \[Zn(OH)_4^{2-} + 2e^{-} → Zn + 4OH^{-}\]
</p>

<div align="justify">
To combat shape change, which refers to the macro redistribution of active material through
zincate transport in bulk electrolyte, it is important that the zincate reduction be much
faster than the first step. Though similar to deep charging a typical Zn||NiOOH battery, which uses a ZnO powder electrode, there are a couple differences.
By using a much lower concentration of electrolyte (3M KOH) and a higher over potential in a custom electrochemcial cell,
we were able to promote a uniform reaction and reduce >95% of all ZnO into the bicontinuous zinc structure.
In addition, we performed 2D erosion analysis on binarized SEM images and powder compact model to demonstrate how our unique bicontinous structure maintains connectivity
at high depths of discharge. Developing the fabrication method and simulations was my primary tasks in this project.

To better understand our electrochemical performance, we can benchmark our performance in Zn||NIOOH coin cells against other state of the art zinc electrodes reported in literature.
We were able to demonstrate a high cycle life and areal capacity with realistic charge/discharge testing parameters and a very scalable manufacturing process.
