I co-founded KT Lucid as a custom signet rings jewelry company specifically for private American high schools.
Operational from 2017-2020, my co-founding partner and I realized that industry standard manufacturing methods
were not able to recreate the geometric features of a school emblem scaled to the size of a ring at a competitive price point.
Therefore, we started a company that leverages new manufacturing processes to create a more detailed ring.

Taking an artistic and engineering approach to developing the ring, we used rapid prototyping to validate designs while gathering consumer feedback from students.
Part of the approach relied on heavy use of computer-aided manufacturing and design, which was inspired from our high school mechanical design engineering experiences.
We sold the rings through our website's online sales portal and at in-person events, where we were able to communicate with our customers directly.
Furthermore, we created a reliable manufacturing pipeline working with supply chains in the Greater Bay Area.

Ultimately my co-founder and I decided to stop pursuing this venture as we became more interested in other opportunities.
However,  our products are still available on our [website](https://www.ktlucid.com) for viewing.
