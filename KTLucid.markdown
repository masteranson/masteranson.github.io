## KT Lucid Manufacturing
<div align="justify"> My experience with KT Lucid has allowed me the unique opportunity to travel overseas to Shenzhen and Dongguan to work directly with suppliers. It has also allowed me to utilize advanced manufacturing techniques such as CNC Milling (3, 4 and 5 axis) and 3D printing of molds to produce high quality jewelry.</div>
