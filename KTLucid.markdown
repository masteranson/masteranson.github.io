KT Lucid was a company operational from 2017-2019 selling custom signet rings for schools.
My founding partner and I realized that current industry standard manufacturing methods were not able to recreate the geometric features of a school emblem scaled to the size of a ring, at a competitive price point.
Therefore, we decided to start a company that leverages new manufacturing processes to create a more detailed ring.

<div align="justify">
Taking an artistic and engineering approach to developing the ring, we used rapid prototyping to validate design while gathering consumer feedback.
We sold the rings through our website's online sales portal as well as through in person events, where we were able to communicate with our customers directly.
Furthermore, we were able to create a reliable manufacturing pipeline working with supply chains in the Greater Bay Area.
Part of our approach was heavy use of computer-aided manufacturing and design, which was inspired from our mechanical design engineering experiences.

Ultimately my co-founder and I decided to stop pursuing this venture as we bacame more interested in other opportunities.
