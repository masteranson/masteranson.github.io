<div align="justify"> My experience with KT Lucid has allowed me the unique opportunity to travel to Shenzhen and
  Dongguan to work directly with suppliers. It has also allowed me to utilize advanced manufacturing techniques such as CNC Milling (3, 4 and 5 axis) and
  3D printing of molds to produce high quality jewelry.</div>

### The Devil is in the Details
---
<div align="justify"> Crafting jewelry is long thought only as an art. I disagree. A beautiful product
requires both engineering ingenuity and the ability to recognize elegance. Today I'll show you how
we made the Kent School signet ring. All jewelry starts with a concept, a physical representation to a particular memory or emotion.
The invoked design is then quickly translated from paper to model. After we are satisfied with the inital design, we generated some renderings and surveyed the response to a control group. These inputs
are used to make the final tweaks.<br />

</div>
<br />
We then move on to rapid prototyping. The first step is utilize additive manufacturing to visualize the product and identify
any potential manufacturing challenges with the ring.

<br />

After the design phase, we needed to figure out how we can manufacture the ring. So experimented with various manufacuturing methods, each with a unique lead time, cost and logistical challenge. The most important
 factor, however, we consider is quality. That is why a stringent quality assessment was made for each sample.

<br />

After finalizing the manufacturing details and establishing our supply chain, we begin marketing and selling the ring. Ultimately, I found that providing a luxurious customer experience had just as much effect on sales
 as a actual good product.

## Constant Improvement

<div align="justify"> TL;DR: Through continually asking questions and exploring new manufacturing techniques
  we were able to lower costs by 65% while reducing manufacturing lead time from months to weeks. </div>
