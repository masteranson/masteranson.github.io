I am very fortunate to have such an amazing experience at AMPD Energy during the Summer of 2020. As part of a small mechanical engineering team, I was able to hold direct responsibility in a multiple projects. In particular, I was able to utilize different modeling techniques to analyze the thermal performance of the Enertainer, a lithium ion battery replacement for diesel generators.

## Lumped-Element Dynamical Model

One of the big questions that was not answered prior to this study was what influences the temperature the most. Whether it was due to ohmic heating of the battery cells, or from external environmental factors. By utilizing PV-Lib and Simscape libraries on MATLAB, we were able to develop a data driven, multi-physics thermal model to study the dynamical response for the Enertainer. By incorporating field data collected, as well as historical weather data, we were able to better understand the temperature fluctuations observed.

## Conjugate Heat Transfer CFD Model

A chain is only as strong as the weakest link. Ensuring homogeneity in temperature distribution across the pack is a parameter that at AMPD we try to optimize for. To study the efficiency of our convective pack cooling system, we needed to utilize a CFD model to determine the surface heat transfer coefficient values, and even using the result back in our dynamical model.

Through extracting meaningful insights from these models, we were able to identify key bottlenecks in our thermal system, and identified key components that could benefit significant from a top-down redesign. I was also involved with various structural redesigns within the battery compartment that lead a weight saving of over 200 kilograms!
