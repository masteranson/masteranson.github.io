<div align="justify">
<a href="http://hytechracing.gatech.edu">HyTech Racing</a> is Georgia Techâ€™s student-run electric race car team. We compete in the most popular collegiate engineering competition in North America, Formula SAE.
As the president from 2021- 2022, I was responsible for the overall vehicle design, development timeline, financial outlook, and operations of the team.
I was also extremely involved personally in the development of the electric drives systems on the vehicle, which includes the battery pack and the powertrain.
Furthermore, I spearheaded the vehicle performance and modeling, which were used to guide architectural decisions.

### What we have done this year

<div align="justify">
In race car engineering, everything has trade-offs, and quantifying the effect of design decisions is the key to building a winning vehicle. Let's picture this scenario.
On the surface, it seems increasing the downforce generated by our aerodynamic wings will directly lead to a faster car, because it increases our max lateral acceleration.
In reality, it also has the unintended consequence of increasing energy consumption, leading to a heavier battery pack. To understand these dynamic relationships, specific to our competition track,
requires the use of numerical modeling. By developing our own set of vehicle simulation tools, we were able to design a well balanced race car that maximizes point scoring.

<div align="justify">
Once we have decided on the system level specifications, it is then time to get our hands dirty with detailed component design.
This is an exceptional challenge, given the shear scale of engineering required to engineer a fully custom electric vehicle from scratch.
We approached this by dividing the work into respective sub-systems (i.e Propulsion, Suspension, High Voltage Controls, etc).
Then, we carefully integrate these sub-systems on a mechanical, electrical and systems level back into the vehicle.
The exploded view below highlights the different mechanical subsystems that exist in HT06.

<div align="justify">
As a team, we often spend long nights at our shop space getting our hands dirty and working on the car. Often times, we are not able to
capture all the design mistakes ahead of actually fabricating the pats, so being able to prototype and test quickly is extremely important to us.

<div align="justify">
For us, hard data always beat simulation results. That is why we priortize testing, especially at a vehicle level.
As soon as we have a running 'skeleton' of HT06, we began testing. We systematically verify and benchmark each sub-system, and
held data debriefs to determine our next course of action.

### Competition Results
---
<div align="justify">
Approaching the final event of the competition, we were in contention for the championship.
However, like in all motorsports, disaster struck with 5 corners to go in the very last lap.
An unexpected voltage sag from one of our 84 battery cells triggered our safety system to shut off the car.
Ultimately, we still managed to achieve a 3rd place overall amongst 58 teams.
Though it was a bittersweet result for the team, we are very proud of what we achieved.  <br />
