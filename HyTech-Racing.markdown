### The Design
---
Transitioning to a new competition, our goal is to maximize b performance and significantly increasing reliability, with 90% backwards compatability in parts.

The issue of keeping the battery temperature within an accepted operating range is a significant issue that Formula E, the highest level of electric motorsports racing, faces.
As our battery management system is designed to shut off the vehicle if the temperature measured at the cell tabs exceeds 60C, we must design a light, efficient cooling package to meet our requirements.
After conversing with GEOX Dragon Racing, an American Formula E racing team about general cooling strategies.

With sufficient cooling, we are currently running a 72s1p battery configuration. With no parallel circuitry, this simplifies both the mechanical and electrical systems,
while not compromising on power. The battery pack is also designed to be highly serviceable with modular battery segments and power electronics. Significant weight was also saved by switching to
all aluminum high current bus-bars. The cell is optimized to recieve a 10psi pressure at 10% cell expansion during high current discharge from the non linear Bisco BF-2000 foam donated by Rogers Coperation
and cut by LGS Technologies.

### Bringing the beast to life

Putting together the battery pack requires sourcing and manufacturing, thousands of components with an extremely limited budget.
 I am grateful for my teammembers who tackled this challenge together with resourcefulness and resilience.

<br />

A lot of custom components are manufactured in house, including the two battery cell withstraining plates at each ends of a battery module. After optimizing the part using FEA static analysis
 to reduce weight while maintaining machinability and minimal deflection, we program the CAM to manufacture the parts on a HAAS 3-axis CNC mill.

However, ultimately as a student team we do not have access to all of the various manufacturing equipment to make every single piece. Instead, we rely on the support of our sponsors, located
all over the US, for their assistance.

<br />

<div align="justify">I directly coordinate manufacturing with
local and international OEM manufacturers for the thousands of special components,
such as special non-linear expansion limiting foam and environmental sealing silicone gaskets.</div>

But perhaps the most exciting development of this season is our partnership with Melasta Co Ltd, a small battery manufacturer from China.

pouch cells in Dongguan, China. We were able to secure a deal for a small production run,
where a custom electrode cutting die was required and a modification to their electrode stacking schedule.

Ultimately, the competition transitioned to an 'online' event format. Along with school cancellation, I was unable to complete the pack as of {{ site.time | date: '%b %d, %Y' }}.
