### The Design
---
<div align="justify">
Our goal is to maximize power delivery and increasing reliability, while maintaining a 90% backwards compatability in parts.

The issue of keeping the battery temperature within an accepted operating range is a significant issue that Formula E, the highest level of electric motorsports racing, faces.
Our lightweight convective air cooling system dissapates enough heat to allow the driver to push the car without having to <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.a-beginners-guide-to-f1-slang.1Pg6tvGZ2y7u4KAnc8WXGl.html">"lift and coast"</a>.
<br />

With sufficient cooling, we are currently running a 72s1p battery configuration. With no parallel circuitry, this simplifies both the mechanical and electrical systems,
while not compromising on power. The battery pack is also designed to be highly serviceable with modular battery segments and power electronics. Significant weight was also saved by switching to
all aluminum high current bus-bars. The cell is optimized to experience 10psi of compression at ~10% cell expansion using non-linear Bisco BF-2000 scilicone foam.

### Bringing the beast to life

<div align="justify">
Putting together the battery pack requires sourcing and manufacturing, thousands of components with an extremely limited budget.
 I am grateful for my teammembers who tackled this challenge together with resourcefulness and resilience.

<br />

A lot of our custom components are manufactured in house, including the cell withstraining plates at each ends of a battery module. After optimizing the part using FEA static analysis
 to reduce weight while maintaining machinability and minimal deflection, we program the CAM to manufacture the parts on a HAAS 3-axis CNC mill. <br />

However, ultimately as a student team we do not have access to all of the various manufacturing equipment to make every single piece. Instead we rely on the support of our sponsors, located
all over the US, for their assistance. <br />

<br />

I directly coordinate manufacturing with
local and international OEM manufacturers for the thousands of special components,
such as special non-linear expansion limiting foam and environmental sealing silicone gaskets.<br />


But perhaps the most exciting development of this season is our partnership with Melasta Co Ltd, a small battery manufacturer from China.<br />

<br />

Ultimately, the competition transitioned to an 'online' event format. Along with school cancellation, I was unable to complete the pack as of {{ site.time | date: '%b %d, %Y' }}. <br />
